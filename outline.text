# Intro

## Thesis

# Context/Background

- define terms
- data model and linked data primer
    - relationships do the heavy lifting to create context and understanding
    - linked data
        - data representation is more flexible
        - easier to get stuff in
        - harder to get stuff out
- explain need for roadmap and answering the 'why'

# Roadmap

## Assessment

- Have to know where we have come and where we are to inform where we are going
- begin with the end in mind (*is this appropriate here?*)
- assess where we are currently
- where have we come from
- what has been done
- what is being done
    - ScholarSearch
    - 856 fields?
    - 0 subfield?
    - Wikipedia/Wikidata work by HBLL Communications
- understand fully the lifecycle of a metadata record 
    - from birth to presentation
    - from creation/copy to ScholarSearch
    - process of creating/importing/maintaining/fixing/converting current records
- usage stats (e.g. ScholarSearch stats tracker)
- user testing
- requirements gathering
    - user focused
    - needs assessment
    - what needs do we have?
    - what is the low hanging fruit we can fix?
- establish metrics for measuring how we did at end
    - optimize/efficient from a tech perspective
    - also important is if our relationships in the library (between divisions/departments) improved through this process
    - Is this a success if our relationships improves?
    - Is this a success if our relationships with patrons (i.e. students, faculty, campus community) improves?

- cataloging > IT
    - learn cataloging work
    - understand the art and science of cataloging
    - How authority work is done
    - How items are cataloged/processed
    - Learning about MARC records and various types of formats and their nuance
        - serials
        - bound width
        - series
        - electronic items?
    - MarcEdit
- understand/appreciate the tech
- understand/appreciate cataloging and metadata
- tech/cataloging forums for library
    - are there existing forums where this is shared with the library?
- regular trainings (monthly? biweekly?)
- ongoing training to help staff in smaller groups rather than everyone all at once

## Community outreach and involvement

- attend conferences
- publish in journals
- present at conferences
- reach out to other institutions to learn from their experiences
    - U of U
    - U of Nevada
    - Stanford
    - U.C. Davis
    - Cornell
    - Harvard
    - International? Academic research libraries in Europe?
    - LOC
- join professional or standards organizations/commitees/projects
    - BIBFRAME
    - OCLC project passage
    - LD4P
    - PCC
    - NACO/SACO
    - semantic web orgs
    - Schema.org and bibliographic extension (https://bib.schema.org)
    - IFLA
- talk with vendors?

## Update data

- reconcile and enrich
- existing/known upgrade tasks
- can we measure the number of types of data upgrading needed?
- generate reports on data needing upgrading?
- prioritize upgrade tasks
    - low hanging fruit
    - more complex data issues
- determine acceptable level of upgraded
- headings that aren't authorizing
- data consistency
- duplicates
- determine toolsets and workflows
    - MarcEdit
    - (Shieh & Reese, 2015)
    - OpenRefine
    - Scripts
    - source control system
        - see history of changes
        - revert
        - see diffs
- add URIs (reconciliation)
    - automate as much as feesibly possible
    - have staff review
    - use various sources (LCNAF, VIAF, LCSH, Worldcat identities)
    - use reconciliation services where available
    - be able to mint our own local URIs
- Named-entity resolution (NER) 
    - link to Wikidata/Wikipedia
- start with smaller chunks of data to gain experience
    - sample from the local NAF
    - try to extract more value out of the NAF
    - types of bibliographic records (e.g. by format or location)
    - sources of records (i.e. Sirsi, ArchivesSpace, CONTENTdm)
- Apply to larger amounts of data working towards applying it to all sets of data

## Legacy data conversion

- in parallel (or in addition) to existing systems
- determine tools and workflows
    - source control system
- convert MARC to RDF (BIBFRAME? Schema.org?)
- convert RDF to MARC to check how well our conversion did and improve the conversion process
- progressive conversion
    - map out the discrete sets of data to convert
    - convert a set at a time
    - qa/qc after each conversion
- develop crosswalks between formats
    - BIBFRAME to Schema.org
    - MARC to BIBFRAME
    - MARC to Schema.org + bib
    - ArchivesSpace + EAD
    - CONTENTdm + DC

## Data publication

- ways of publishing
- publisher and consumer of linked data (i.e. pull info down from other sources like Wikipedia and display with local bibliographic/authority metadata)
- Jacob Shelby
- 5 stars of linked data (Tim Berners-Lee)
- integrate with ScholarSearch
    - goal is to improve what and how we show information to patron
    - where can we help improve ScholarSearch data ingestion/transformation process?
- create/experiment with new ways of exploring/browing/searching the data

## Native linked-data production

- new workbench/tools/processes
    - use 3rd part tools where they work
    - otherwise will need to develop tools in-house
    - bus/event driven
    - evolve over time
    - could evolve to a de-integrated library system with a common set/vocabulary of data with solid interoperability
- source control
    - diff changes
    - history of changes and revert
- less typing and more lookup and dropdown lists (strings to things)
- helps in system to format data entry appropriately
- strongly typed 
- be able to check/verify the data are valid
- data storage in ILS vs. data model
    - don't need to understand how the ILS is storing the data
    - how and what things can be said

## Evaluation

- reflection and lessons learned
- compare results to assessment outcomes/goals/objectives
- user tests
- did we accomplish what we set out to accomplish?
- did we improve things for the patron and staff?
- Our our relationships with each other in the library and with other interested parties and patrons better than we started?
- Our interested parties happier as an outcome of our efforts?

## Communication

- essential to this working
- don't make assumptions when deciding things
- make sure to involve the right people for each phase and project

## Phase 2

### Goals

- update MARC data to include URIs
- convert legacy data
- ability to convert from MARC to LD, LD to MARC

## Phase 3

### Goals

- ability to catalog directly to LD (no MARC)

# Conclusion
