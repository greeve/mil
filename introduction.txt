# Prompt

In an effort to increase the visibility of collections, the library community has identified linked-data as a means to publish metadata describing their holdings on the WWW. With such metadata available to search engines libraries will become positioned where people actually look for information, -- on Yandex, or Google. The idea is simple, but the process is not.

Optimizing metadata for the Web will prove to be a massive, long-term undertaking involving both native linked-data production and legacy metadata conversion. For this presentation, outline a mult-year roadmap for the Harold B. Lee Library to transition from "signpost" encoding models like MARC-21, EAD3 and Dublin Core to the use of URIs, HTTP and RDF. Identify and discuss major milestones in the process, with specific attention directed to entity resolution.

Plan your presentation to last 40 minutes. This will allow 15 minutes for questions.

# Thesis

In 1931 S. R. Ranganathan posited five laws of library science:

1. Books are for use.
2. Every reader his/her book.
3. Every book its reader.
4. Save the time of the reader.
5. The library is a growing organism.

I want to focus our attention on the fifth law: the library is a growing organism.

“It is an accepted biological fact that a growing organism alone will survive. An organism which ceases to grow will petrify and perish. The Fifth Law invites our attention to thefact that the library, as an institution, has all theattributes of a growing organism. A growing organism takes in new matter, casts off old matter, changes in size and takes new shapes and forms. Apart from sudden and apparently discontinuous changes involved in metamorphosis, it is also subject to a slow continuous change which leads to what is known as 'variation', in biological parlance, and to the evolution of new forms. This change is so slow but so effective that the protagonists of evolution assert that it is the shapeless undifferentiated protozoa of the Palaeozoic agethat has transformed itself, by successive stages of variation, into the most differentiated specimen of creation —the human being. The one thing that has been persisting through all those changes of form has been the vital principle of life. So it is with the library” (Ranganathan, 1931, p. 382-383).

“But the vital principle of the library—whichhas struggled through all the stages of its evolution,
is common to all its different forms and will persistto be its distinguishing feature for all time to come—is that it is an instrument of universal education,
and assembles together and freely distributes allthe tools of education and disseminates knowledga
with their aid. This vital principle—'the spirit ofthe library'—persisting through all its forms islike the inner man;” (Ranganathan, 1931, p. 415). 

The transition from “signpost” library metadata encoding models like MARC21, EAD, and Dublin Core to the use of linked data will be a massive, long-term undertaking. The success of this work will depend upon establishing a multi-year roadmap that includes objectives and milestones and considers the need for linked-data production, legacy metadata conversion, and entity resolution.
