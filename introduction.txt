# Introduction

In an effort to increase the visibility of collections, the library community has identified linked-data as a means to publish metadata describing their holdings on the WWW. With such metadata available to search engines libraries will become positioned where people actually look for information, -- on Yandex, or Google. The idea is simple, but the process is not.

Optimizing metadata for the Web will prove to be a massive, long-term undertaking involving both native linked-data production and legacy metadata conversion. For this presentation, outline a mult-year roadmap for the Harold B. Lee Library to transition from "signpost" encoding models like MARC-21, EAD3 and Dublin Core to the use of URIs, HTTP and RDF. Identify and discuss major milestones in the process, with specific attention directed to entity resolution.

Plan your presentation to last 40 minutes. This will allow 15 minutes for questions.

From Panizzi’s revolutionary ideas about works and books, to Cutters and Dewey’s rules for the catalog and cataloging, to Ranganathan’s laws of library science

In 1931 S. R. Ranganathan proposed five laws of library science that stand as part of the rich foundation of librarianship.

1. Books are for use.
2. Every reader his/her book.
3. Every book its reader.
4. Save the time of the reader.
5. The library is a growing organism.

Many scholars have riffed on these five laws over the years to account for changes and advances in the world and in library science. Other media or format types, the WWW, 

One scholar, Michael Gorman, updated Ranganathan’s work and created these five laws:

1. Libraries serve humanity
2. Respect all forms by which knowledge is communicated
3. Use technology intelligently to enhance service
4. Protect free access to knowledge
5. Honor the past and create the future

## Thesis

The transition from “signpost” library metadata encoding models like MARC21, EAD, and Dublin Core to the use of linked data will be a massive, long-term undertaking. The success of this work will depend upon establishing a multi-year roadmap that includes objectives and milestones and considers the need for linked-data production, legacy metadata conversion, and entity resolution.
