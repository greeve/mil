# Risks

- security and privacy
    - how open should the data be?
    - what do we want available?
    - XML, other tech that may expose a vulnerability?
- less mature tooling ecosystem
    - db tech not as mature as RMDBS
    - less number of tools to work with data
- takes more effort to get data out
- barriers to extract use the data but huge rewards when you do
- open world assumption and Non-unique naming assumption
    - some messiness in data
    - no one cannonical source necessarily by virtue of the tech/standards
    - this can be seen as a virtue but coming from other data model paradigms it may seem as a weakness
